            The original Roomba was released by iRobot in 2002. Since then, the term "robot vacuum" has come to be associated with the Roomba brand. iRobot consistently maintains its lead in innovation and secures a place in our ranking of the top robot vacuums, despite the entry of numerous other companies onto the market.

            The first robot vacuum with a charging port that also emptied the dustbin was the Roomba i7+, which iRobot unveiled in September 2018. In response to user input, iRobot improved the i7+'s functionality and design
            before releasing the s9+, the company's newest flagship model, in October 2019.
